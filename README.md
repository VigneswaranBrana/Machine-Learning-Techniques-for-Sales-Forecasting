# Machine Learning Techniques for Sales Forecasting

## Overview

Machine learning has grown into an important area of data science and is gaining ground due to its high forecasting and predictive power, which has led to the need for highly accurate sales forecasting and other important areas. To accurately predict future events, machine learning models study data to learn patterns that are used to predict future events. Accurate forecasting models can significantly increase store profits and are vital to your organization as they not only improve overall profits but also provide insight into how you can better serve your customers.

## Machine Learning Techniques

Here are the machine learning techniques that can be applied to sales forecasting:

1. **Decision Tree**
2. **Linear Regression**
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **Logistic Regression**
6. **Stochastic Gradient Descent**
7. **Extra Tree**
8. **XGBoost**
9. **Ridge Regression**
10. **Lasso Regression**
11. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
12. **ADABoost**
13. **Bayesian Ridge**
14. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
15. **LSTM Regression Model with Keras**
16. **Stacked Model 1 - Random Forest + XGBoost + Extra Tree**
17. **Stacked Model 2 - SVC + KNN + Lasso**
